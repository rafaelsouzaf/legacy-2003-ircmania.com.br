# legacy-2003-ircmania.com.br
Made in 2002/2003. IRCMania (and ChatMania) was the biggest and most famous website about IRC in portuguese language. All website was made for me. From scratch.

This website had a lot of features like:

- Columnists
- WebIRC
- Live search in some IRC Networks
- Live statistics about some IRC Networks
- News (a lot)
- Emoticons
- Downloads

*** Remember, this website is old. In this time we didin't have frameworks like Bootstrap (or Jquery!!!).

*** Database included.
